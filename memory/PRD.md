# PRD — 58:12 Global Connect CRM

## Original problem statement (source of truth)
Multi-tenant CRM for 58:12 Global's Uganda operations, covering unified
comms, campus-scoped tasks/calendar/events, double-entry finance with
strict location enforcement, HR/payroll with weekly & multi-cadence pay,
kiosk check-ins, NFC badge issuance + PWA Wallet passes, guest passes,
social work, sales/POS/shipments, and self-service user portal.

## Current status (as of iter 298)

### DONE
- Unified finance ledger (JEs) + AP + bank reconcile + Receipt Review Queue.
- MongoDB hot-path indexes across finance/HR/access collections.
- PWA offline data + wallet pass cache + prefetch on login + offline pill.
- Director digest email + preview widget with inline snooze.
- Portal self-service badges (own + child), weekly Mon–Sun timesheet,
  wage_type on salaries.
- **iter 299:** Badge PNG download (html2canvas capture — photo + QR
  actually saved) + proper Print flow with print-only CSS. Portal profile
  now edits DOB + gender (whitelisted server-side, verified end-to-end).
  Portal `Scan a receipt` card wired to the existing Finance OCR
  pipeline. Manual Payslip UI shortcut confirmed present.

### Remaining backlog (agreed with user)
- **Next (c)** `server.py` modularization (~1750 lines).
- Portal receipt-scan (deferred — took defaults).
- Portal audit sweep (spot-check name/DOB/phone/address flows end-to-end).
