## Completed Features (Iterations 49-78)
All features documented in /app/ADMIN_GUIDE.md and /app/memory/CHANGELOG.md.

## Recently Resolved — Iteration 78 (May 1, 2026)

### Part B — P1 + Selected P2 (verified 5/5 backend PASS)
- ✅ **HR Auto-Payday Payslip** — `POST /api/hr/payslips/generate-payday` generates missing payslips for campuses whose `pay_day` matches today. Idempotent. "Run Payday Now" button on HR → Payslips tab.
- ✅ **Multi-campus user creation** — `POST /api/admin/users` now accepts `location_ids` array (mirrors to member record; expands parent campuses).
- ✅ **Finance Dialogs** — 4 `window.prompt()` call sites replaced with real Dialog forms: Transfer, Budget, Revalue Asset, Set Starting Balance.
- ✅ **Variant Barcode Printing UI** — new `VariantBarcodePrint` component (JsBarcode CODE128) with layouts 4×6 / 3×8 / 2×5 grid + single-per-page; copies multiplier; print-preview + `window.open` print.
- ✅ **PWA Wallet Passes Offline** — `sw.js` dedicated `WALLET_CACHE` with cache-first + stale-while-revalidate for `/api/wallet-badge/*` and `/badge/:token`; `prefetch-wallet-pass` message handler.

### Part A — Routing/Filtering Fixes (6 bugs) verified 9/9 backend PASS

- ✅ **Bug 1: Tasks Assignee Scope** — `/api/admin/users/directory` now returns only active staff roles (admin, system_admin, Executive Director, Adviser, Director, Manager, Leader, Coordinator, Staff, HR, Volunteer) scoped to `get_campus_filter`. `include_all=true` reserved for sysadmins. TasksPage `boardStaff` further filters by board location.
- ✅ **Bug 2: Restricted Location Filtering** — `get_campus_filter` in `/app/backend/deps.py` now excludes restricted sub-locations (`is_restricted: true`) for non-sysadmins unless the user's `location_ids` explicitly includes that sub-location.
- ✅ **Bug 3: Chat Ghost Users** — `CommsPage.jsx` now uses `chatApi.users()` (the scoped `/api/chat/users` endpoint) instead of `/api/members`, so only active in-scope users appear.
- ✅ **Bug 4: Multi-Campus Switcher** — `PUT /api/user/active-campus` now allows regular users to switch among campuses in their `location_ids`; admins/EDs retain global switch. 400 for missing id, 403 for campuses outside assignment.
- ✅ **Bug 5: Scheduler Scope + Auto-Time** — `VolunteerSchedulingPage.jsx` uses `adminApi.userDirectory()` (scoped). Selecting a Linked Event auto-populates title, date, start_time, end_time, location_id.
- ✅ **Bug 6: Tasks on Main Calendar** — `CalendarPage.jsx` fetches `tasksApi.list()` and renders tasks with `due_date` as blue "task" events. Clicking navigates to `/boards?board=<id>&task=<id>`.
- ✅ **Bonus: Admin Role Guard** — `create_user`, `admin_update_user`, `bulk_update_users` block non-sysadmins from assigning admin/system_admin/Executive Director roles.

## Pending / Backlog

### P1
- (Optional polish) Add `<DialogDescription>` to the 4 new Finance dialogs to clear radix a11y console warning.
- Verify/tune HR auto-payday against production scheduling preferences (cron on backend startup?).

### P2
- Finance `prompt()` cleanup: receipt URL upload in expense edit (line ~438 FinancialPage.jsx) still uses prompt — last holdout.
- `server.py` modularization (oversized)
- `UnifiedPeoplePage.jsx` split (~1400 lines)
- Full PWA offline beyond Wallet Passes (app shell + last-viewed pages)
- Wave H5 SDK native upgrade
- Scheduled cron jobs for overdue task emails

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB + Motor + JWT auth. Routers under `/app/backend/routers/`.
